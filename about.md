## Our joint effort: diversity, equity, and inclusion
Our mission is to create and maintain guidelines for human ultrasonic neuromodulation to build the strongest possible foundations for research and clinical application. We aim to accelerate these developments by advancing safety, reporting, and reproducibility of research. We can achieve this by working together and sharing our advances. This endeavor is for and by all of us. We strive for a research culture that is open, inclusive, and diverse. We believe all researchers should have equitable access to our resources. We gain strength by welcoming people as they are and we want to value the contribution of every individual. Working together, we can accelerate research and contribute to new discoveries and innovations with real-world applications.
